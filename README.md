# Witch-One
Game for Global Game Jam 2021

This game was made for Global Game Jam 2021, which had the theme "Lost and Found." We planned to create a game where you work in a witches' lost and found,
cataloguing magical items that have been misplaced. You must help them find their belongings based on their somewhat cryptic clues. The game is currently
incomplete, but we plan on continuing work after the jam has ended.
